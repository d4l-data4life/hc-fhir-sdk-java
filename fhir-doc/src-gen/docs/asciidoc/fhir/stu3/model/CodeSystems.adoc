= Code Systems

Generated from FHIR 3.0.1.11917 on 2019-06-14

== Description

Many elements in the FHIR resources have a coded value: some fixed string (a sequence of characters) assigned elsewhere that identifies some defined "concept". The sequence of characters and its meaning may be defined in one of several places:

* As one of a set of fixed values defined in this specification
* In an internet RFC (e.g. mime type, language)
* An HL7 specification (HL7 v3 code system, or HL7 v2 table)
* Some external terminology or ontology such as LOINC, or SNOMED CT
* A locally maintained dictionary, look up table or enumeration in an application (for further discussion of locally defined value sets, see "Profiling FHIR"

These methods of defining codes are collectively called `code systems`. This list is far from complete; there are many ways to define code systems, and they vary widely in sophistication and size.

VISUAL_GROUP:: Any group marked with this behavior should be displayed as a visual group to the end user
LOGICAL_GROUP:: A group with this behavior logically groups its sub-elements, and may be shown as a visual group to the end user, but it is not required to do so
SENTENCE_GROUP:: A group of related alternative actions is a sentence group if the target referenced by the action is the same in all the actions and each action simply constitutes a different variation on how to specify the details for the target. For example, two actions that could be in a SentenceGroup are "aspirin, 500 mg, 2 times per day" and "aspirin, 300 mg, 3 times per day". In both cases, aspirin is the target referenced by the action, and the two actions represent different options for how aspirin might be ordered for the patient. Note that a SentenceGroup would almost always have an associated selection behavior of "AtMostOne", unless it's a required action, in which case, it would be "ExactlyOne"

RELATEDTO:: The concepts are related to each other, and have at least some overlap in meaning, but the exact relationship is not known
EQUIVALENT:: The definitions of the concepts mean the same thing (including when structural implications of meaning are considered) (i.e. extensionally identical).
EQUAL:: The definitions of the concepts are exactly the same (i.e. only grammatical differences) and structural implications of meaning are identical or irrelevant (i.e. intentionally identical).
WIDER:: The target mapping is wider in meaning than the source concept.
SUBSUMES:: The target mapping subsumes the meaning of the source concept (e.g. the source is-a target).
NARROWER:: The target mapping is narrower in meaning than the source concept. The sense in which the mapping is narrower SHALL be described in the comments in this case, and applications should be careful when attempting to use these mappings operationally.
SPECIALIZES:: The target mapping specializes the meaning of the source concept (e.g. the target is-a source).
INEXACT:: The target mapping overlaps with the source concept, but both source and target cover additional meaning, or the definitions are imprecise and it is uncertain whether they have the same boundaries to their meaning. The sense in which the mapping is narrower SHALL be described in the comments in this case, and applications should be careful when attempting to use these mappings operationally.

INVARIANT:: A content validation rule failed - e.g. a schematron rule.
SECURITY:: An authentication/authorization/permissions issue of some kind.
LOGIN:: The client needs to initiate an authentication process.
UNKNOWN:: The user or system was not able to be authenticated (either there is no process, or the proferred token is unacceptable).
EXPIRED:: User session expired; a login may be required.
FORBIDDEN:: The user does not have the rights to perform this action.
SUPPRESSED:: Some information was not or may not have been returned due to business rules, consent or privacy rules, or access permission constraints.  This information may be accessible through alternate processes.
PROCESSING:: Processing issues. These are expected to be final e.g. there is no point resubmitting the same content unchanged.
NOT_SUPPORTED:: The resource or profile is not supported.
DUPLICATE:: An attempt was made to create a duplicate record.
NOT_FOUND:: The reference provided was not found. In a pure RESTful environment, this would be an HTTP 404 error, but this code may be used where the content is not found further into the application architecture.
TOO_LONG:: Provided content is too long (typically, this is a denial of service protection type of error).
CODE_INVALID:: The code or system could not be understood, or it was not valid in the context of a particular ValueSet.code.
EXTENSION:: An extension was found that was not acceptable, could not be resolved, or a modifierExtension was not recognized.
TOO_COSTLY:: The operation was stopped to protect server resources; e.g. a request for a value set expansion on all of SNOMED CT.
BUSINESS_RULE:: The content/operation failed to pass some business rule, and so could not proceed.
CONFLICT:: Content could not be accepted because of an edit conflict (i.e. version aware updates) (In a pure RESTful environment, this would be an HTTP 404 error, but this code may be used where the conflict is discovered further into the application architecture.)
INCOMPLETE:: Not all data sources typically accessed could be reached, or responded in time, so the returned information may not be complete.
TRANSIENT:: Transient processing issues. The system receiving the error may be able to resubmit the same content once an underlying issue is resolved.
LOCK_ERROR:: A resource/record locking failure (usually in an underlying database).
NO_STORE:: The persistent store is unavailable; e.g. the database is down for maintenance or similar action.
EXCEPTION:: An unexpected internal error has occurred.
TIMEOUT:: An internal timeout has occurred.
THROTTLED:: The system is not prepared to handle this request due to load management.
INFORMATIONAL:: A message unrelated to the processing success of the completed operation (examples of the latter include things like reminders of password expiry, system maintenance times, etc.).

    MEASURE_OBSERVATION
}

--

==== Codes
INITIAL_POPULATION:: The initial population refers to all patients or events to be evaluated by a quality measure involving patients who share a common set of specified characterstics. All patients or events counted (for example, as numerator, as denominator) are drawn from the initial population
NUMERATOR:: The upper portion of a fraction used to calculate a rate, proportion, or ratio. Also called the measure focus, it is the target process, condition, event, or outcome. Numerator criteria are the processes or outcomes expected for each patient, or event defined in the denominator. A numerator statement describes the clinical action that satisfies the conditions of the measure
NUMERATOR_EXCLUSION:: Numerator exclusion criteria define patients or events to be removed from the numerator. Numerator exclusions are used in proportion and ratio measures to help narrow the numerator (for inverted measures)
DENOMINATOR:: The lower portion of a fraction used to calculate a rate, proportion, or ratio. The denominator can be the same as the initial population, or a subset of the initial population to further constrain the population for the purpose of the measure
DENOMINATOR_EXCLUSION:: Denominator exclusion criteria define patients or events that should be removed from the denominator before determining if numerator criteria are met. Denominator exclusions are used in proportion and ratio measures to help narrow the denominator. For example, patients with bilateral lower extremity amputations would be listed as a denominator exclusion for a measure requiring foot exams
DENOMINATOR_EXCEPTION:: Denominator exceptions are conditions that should remove a patient or event from the denominator of a measure only if the numerator criteria are not met.

DERIVED_FROM:: The target resource (Observation or QuestionnaireResponse) is part of the information from which this observation value is derived. (e.g. calculated anion gap, Apgar score)  NOTE:  "derived-from" is the only logical choice when referencing QuestionnaireResponse.
SEQUEL_TO:: This observation follows the target observation (e.g. timed tests such as Glucose Tolerance Test).
REPLACES:: This observation replaces a previous observation (i.e. a revised value). The target observation is now obsolete.
QUALIFIED_BY:: The value of the target observation qualifies (refines) the semantics of the source observation (e.g. a lipemia measure target from a plasma measure).
INTERFERED_BY:: The value of the target observation interferes (degrades quality, or prevents valid observation) with the semantics of the source observation (e.g. a hemolysis measure target from a plasma potassium measure, which has no value).

CANCELLED:: The observation is unavailable because the measurement was not started or not completed (also sometimes called "aborted").
ENTERED_IN_ERROR:: The observation has been withdrawn following previous final release.  This electronic record should never have existed, though it is possible that real-world decisions were based on it. (If real-world activity has occurred, the status should be "cancelled" rather than "entered-in-error".)

CHECK:: Use this version of the code system. If a value set specifies a different version, the expansion operation should fail
OVERRIDE:: Use this version of the code system irrespective of which version is specified by a value set. Note that this has obvious safety issues, in that it may result in a value set expansion giving a different list of codes that is both wrong and unsafe, and implementers should only use this capability reluctantly. It primarily exists to deal with situations where specifications have fallen into decay as time passes. If a  version is override, the version used SHALL explicitly be represented in the expansion parameters
