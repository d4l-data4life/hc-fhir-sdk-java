/**
 * MedicationStatement.java
 * <p>
 * A record of a medication that is being consumed by a patient.   A MedicationStatement may indicate that the patient
 * may be taking the medication now or has taken the medication in the past or will be taking the medication in the
 * future.  The source of this information can be the patient, significant other (such as a family member or spouse), or
 * a clinician.  A common scenario where this information is captured is during the history taking process during a
 * patient visit or stay.   The medication information may come from sources such as the patient's memory, from a
 * prescription bottle,  or from a list of medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains.
 * <p>
 * The primary difference between a medication statement and a medication administration is that the medication
 * administration has complete administration information and is based on actual administration information from the
 * person who administered the medication.  A medication statement is often, if not always, less specific.  There is no
 * required date/time when the medication was administered, in fact we only know that a source has reported the patient
 * is taking this medication, where details such as time, quantity, or rate or even medication product may be incomplete
 * or missing or less precise.  As stated earlier, the medication statement information may come from the patient's
 * memory, from a prescription bottle or from a list of medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains.
 * Medication administration is more formal and is not missing detailed information.
